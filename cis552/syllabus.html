<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>The course grade will be determined as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">Homework assignments</td>
<td align="left">50%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">Final project</td>
<td align="left">20%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">Class participation</td>
<td align="left">30%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr>
<h2 id="homeworkproject-submission">Homework/project submission</h2>
<p>Homeworks should be uploaded via the class website by the given due 
date. The late period for homework submission will be 48 hours after the
 deadline. Assignments submitted up to 24 hours late will receive a 10 
point penalty. Assignments submitted up to 48 hours late will receive a 
20 point penalty. After 48 hours, no homework will be accepted.</p>
<p>Homeworks may be submitted multiple times to the course website. Only
 the latest assignment will be graded. If that latest submission is 
during the late period, then the assignment will receive a late penalty,
 even if earlier versions of the assignment were submitted on time.</p>
<h2 id="class-participation">Class participation</h2>
<p>One goal of this course is practice with oral and written technical 
communication. Clarity is a skill that is developed only through 
practice.</p>
<p>Class participation grades will come (qualitatively) from several 
sources: code walkthroughs in class homework discussions, questions and 
comments during class lectures, questions during instructor office 
hours, questions and answers on piazza.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>This course will abide by Penn's code of <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/">academic integrity</a></p>
<p>Of course, many sources of information are available that could help 
you to come up with the answer for the homework assignment. However, 
some of those sources are detrimental to the learning process. 
Therefore, the course instructors have selected specific references that
 are the only ones that may be used while completing your homework 
assignments.</p>
<p>Examples of reference materials that should never be used for this 
course: textbooks not listed on the references webpage, solutions to 
exercises from previous versions of the class (or from similar courses 
at other universities), source code from blog posts, source code from 
packages on hackage, source code solicited or discovered from 
haskell-cafe, #haskell, StackOverflow, or Rent-A-Coder.</p>
<p>In short: You should never COPY code from any source and present it as your own. That's plagiarism.</p>
<p>If you want to include external code in your solution, the best way 
is to import the package from hackage. If that code is not available on 
hackage, then <em>clearly identify</em> the external code in your solution.</p>
<p>Violations of this policy will be dealt with severely. For a first 
violation (on a homework assignment), the penalty will be from 0 to up 
to triple loss of credit. For a repeat violation, or for a violation on 
the project, the student will be forwarded to Penn's Office of Student 
Conduct.</p>
<p>We will use <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/%7Eaiken/moss/">MOSS</a> to automatically detect unallowable collaboration between class members.</p>
<h2 id="class-discussion-and-group-study">Class discussion and group study</h2>
<p>Learning from your peer students is an important component of any 
course. Therefore, we encourage both high-level ("What does it mean to 
be a fold?") and low-level ("Why doesn't my code typecheck?") questions 
among class members.</p>
<p>However, to make sure that <em>all</em> class members get an equal 
chance to participate in such discussions, we encourage you to have such
 discussions in public: in class, on piazza, and during office hours. 
Even if you are in the same room as your classmate, and want to ask a 
question, please post it to piazza, so that everyone in the class may 
benefit from the question and answer.</p>
