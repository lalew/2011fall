\section*{Question 1 for experiment \#1}
\paragraph*{a}
The maximum achievable IPC is 7.998413.
\paragraph*{b}
The size of ROB should be at least 64 to
achieve 4 IPC.

\section*{Question 2 for experiment \#1/\#2/\#3}
\paragraph*{a}
The maximum achievable IPC for conservative handling of memory scheduling is 3.693061.
\paragraph*{b}
It is not achievable.

\paragraph*{c}
The largest difference between unrealistic
and conservative memory scheduling is 
that unrealistic is 116.6\% faster than 
conservative memory scheduling.

\paragraph*{d}
The largest difference between unrealistic
and perfect memory scheduling is that
unrealistic is 3.79\% faster than perfect 
memory scheduling.

\section*{Question 3 for experiment \#4/\#5}
\paragraph*{a}
The maximum achievable IPC for bimodal
is 2.627.
\paragraph*{b}
The maximum achievable IPC for gshare
is 3.901.
\paragraph*{c}
The largest speedup provided by the 
gshare preidcotor over the bimodal 
predictor is that gshare is 48.52 \% faster
than bimodal.
