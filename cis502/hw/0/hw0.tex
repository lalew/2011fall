\newtheorem{fact1}{Fact}

\begin{fact1}\label{fact}
A ship should be the last one that schedules to stay in a port that it 
will remain in.
\end{fact1}

\begin{proof}
By contradiction, we suppose ship $S$ will remain in port $P$, beginning on
day $d$, for the rest of the month, and another ship $S'$  has a schedule to
stay in port $P$ on day $d+x$, where $0 \le x \le (m - d)$. But this will 
conflict with the requirement (\textdagger), therefore $S'$ cannot have a 
schedule to stay in port $P$, namely, $S$ is the last ship that schedule to 
stay in the port $P$.
\end{proof}

In order to proof that a set of truncations can always be found, we can
use contradiction.

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Show a set of truncations can always be found: We can prove this by
contradiction. First, we suppose there is a ship $S$ that cannot find any port
to remain in. 
\end{itemize}
